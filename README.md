# Leetcode 101

To count how many problems you have solved by difficulty level and category: `Usage: ./count.sh` 

I would like to sort problems into categories.

1. BackTrack
2. Binary-Search
3. Bit
4. Dict (Hash map)
5. DP (Dynamic Programming)
6. Graph
7. Greedy
8. Linked-List
9. Priority-Queue
10. Slide-Window
11. Sorting
12. Stack-Queue
13. String
14. Tree
15. Two-Pointer



5, 647 => Manacher algorithm

14 => library OR KMP => extremely hard!

15 => trapped by dict

23 => priority queue OR divide and conquer

49 => sorting or hash

53 => Follow-up => divide and conquer

109 => tree + divide and conquer

69, 153 => binary search trick

8, 31, 33, 47, 73, 75, 89, 92, 109, 110, 128, 130, 139, 238, 240, 287, 1041 => HARD!!!

78, 79, 137 => two solutions

94, 144, 145 => recursion, iterative, Morris

98 => stack also works

Tree => recursion, iterative

125 => `isalnum` `tolower`

136, 190(hard => O(1)), 191, 231, 342, 389 => bit

169 => random OR Boyer-Moore Voting

209 => unordered_set

461 => Brian Kernighan => built-in function for bit!

454 => Meet in the middle attack lol

235, 337, 367, 494, 572 => trick

560 prefix



Still need to do: 4,10,23,32,34,40,42,44,60,72,76,81,90,97,114,115,116,117,124,131,138,143,147,148,149,154,155,164,179,204,207,208,210,211,213,215,221,234,236,347,395,424,437,480,581,600,664,740,1269
